# Automated_Machine_Learning_App_to_predict_age_of_Abalone_by_predicting_rings_counts

Its automated Machine Learning App where all the steps of training and prediction will be done by control on user interface, 

 Automated training Phases 

(1) Name Validation

(2)Data transformation to insert in Database

(3)Database Creation 

(4)Data insertion in Database 

(5)export of data from DB in csv 

(6)Data preprocessing 

(7)Clustering

(8)model building 

(9) saving the model 

Automated Prediction Phases:-

(1) Name Validation

(2)Data transformation to insert in Database

(3)Database Creation

(4)Data insertion in Database 

(5)export of data from DB in csv 

(6)Data preprocessing 

(7)The appropriate cluster 

(8) Calling the appropriate model for chosen cluster 

(9)predicting the result

(10) storing the predicted result in file as well as shown on user interface page
